## **Description**
#### What does the application do?
Breakout is a ball game where you try moving the paddle to bounce the ball to the blocks. When the ball hits a block, the block disappears. The more you bounce, the easier it starts to get since there would be less blocks. Win the game by eliminating all blocks. You will lose when the ball misses the paddle and goes below.
#### What technologies did I use?
I used Python 3.9 because it is easy-to-use. It delivers my purpose through straight forward lines of code. I also used an IDE, PyCharm. This is because it has a great project management system and is friendly to beginners (like me)! Besides Python, I used a module called PyGame , which allowed me to make the game without a game engine.
#### What challenges did I face?
I faced many challenges. I often confuse variables and loops. This caused many errors which I later fixed during the vigorous testing phase. It took a lot of time and debugging. However, I notice that there are still some bugs, so please open an issue if you find them.

## **Installation**
#### Is there any installation process?
No, this is because this game is **NOT** a software or an app. This game is simply a raw piece of Python code. However, you may need a special program to run Python. For long term use, I would recommend PyCharm. If you just want to run this code without going through the faffle of installing IDE software apps, I recommend replit on a web browser. Here are some links:
- Computer Program: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- Computer Program: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download)
- Computer Program: [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Web Browser: [Replit.com](https://replit.com/~) _**Remember, this is a free browser program. Just create a free lifetime account._
However, if you see an error in the code, open the terminal window and type "pip install Turtle" or similar if you are not on a Windows. Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) for you.

## **Using the Project**
#### How to use the project?
Just run it. Again, this is a dead simple piece of raw code. It has a graphics user interface that is originally integrated to Python. It is extremely easy to use with the programs listed above. However, if it gives an error, open the terminal window and type "pip install Turtle".

## **Contribution**
#### How can you contribute to the project?
Simple. Just email me. I will have a look at your profile page and send you an invitation link. 
#### Are there any requirements for contributors?
No, of course not! Who would I be to judge whether you should be able to contribute to the project. Just politely email me and I would happily accept your help. I am determined to set everybody as equals to make this code as good as possible.
#### What are the rules for contributing?
Just don't mess around with the files. Remember that you may be held responsible for sabotage of any sort.

## **Project Features**
#### How many game modes are there?
There are 4 game modes. This includes singleplayer and multiplayer. I have also included a version with 1 ball and another with 2 balls. Of course, you could have an infinite amount of balls as you wish when you edit the code, it would just make the game more challenging (and maybe more fun).
#### Can you cheat?
Of course, you are free to edit the code after you downloaded another copy, where I cannot stop you from deleting the measures. If you coincidentally cheat (meaning you get a bug which helps you get away from losig a point), please open an issue up and I will try to fix it.

## **To-Do List**
- [x] Thorough code testing. ðŸ’»
- [x] Refactor the code. ðŸ’¾
- [x] Make the experience better. ðŸ“·
- [ ] Improve appearance. ðŸŒ»
